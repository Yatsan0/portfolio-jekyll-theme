# Anastasia's Portfolio

Anastasia D.
London, UK
Hi, I am a recent graduate student studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Kingâ€™s College London. Currently, I am studying for my Professional Certificate in Data Analytics online program at Imperial College Business School Executive Education. I am starting to gain experience in many different fields and am eager to learn and seek a challenging role that will help me build my skills. 
I am curious about analyses/research in social science, learning about occurring trends and relevant technologies and looking for many ways to express creativity.
